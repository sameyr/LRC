# Laptop to Single-Board Computer Connection 

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up remote access to your single-board computer. I'll use SSH (Secure Shell) to establish the connection between a laptop and a single-board computer.

## Pre-requisite

1. Single-Board Computer (This guide uses a Raspberry Pi 4)
2. Broadband Connection (Ensure both the laptop and the single-board computer are connected to the same network)
3. Remote Computer (A device from which you will access the single-board computer)
